#CabinTrips - PHP & CodeIgniter App

CabinTrips is a project to provide a calendaring system for those fortunate to have a shared family vacation home. Users can schedule and reserve trips on a shared calendar. Users also have a facebook-style wall to leave posts and comments as well as change information about themselves. Administrators can add users and modify exiting accounts.
